Data (zipfiles) and instructions for testing the ShinyApp CarbonViewer for students in GEO9915 spring 2024.
ShinyApp is accessed through the webpage: https://carbonviewer.nina.no

For using CarbonViewer on a peatland location you need 2 things: 
  1. a shapefile (.shp) with one or more polygons of the area of interest (the extent of the peatland),
  2. a csv-file with coordinates (given in ETRS89, UTM32; EPSG:28532) and peat depth measurements (in m) setup with the column headers "x", "y", and "dybde"
Create a zipfile with the shapefile (and associated files + the csv-file), upload this in the ShinyApp
